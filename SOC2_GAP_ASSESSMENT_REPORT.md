# SOC 2 Gap Assessment Report
## Based on KRATIKAL TECH PVT. LTD SOC 2 Type II Final Report (Jan 2022 - Dec 2022)

### Executive Summary
**Critical Finding**: Significant gap between actual SOC 2 compliance status and current GRC system documentation.

**Previous Audit Status**: CLEAN - All 72 controls tested with **NO EXCEPTIONS NOTED**
**Current GRC System Status**: All 61 controls marked as **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

This represents a major compliance tracking and documentation gap that requires immediate remediation.

## Critical Gaps and Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Documentation Gap (Critical Priority)
**Issue**: All 72 controls that passed previous audit are marked as "not implemented" in current system
**Impact**: Compliance reporting inaccuracy, potential audit failures, management oversight gaps
**Action**: Map all CN01-CN72 controls to corresponding GRC system controls and update status

### 2. Evidence Repository Gap (High Priority)
**Issue**: Previous audit evidence not linked to current GRC system
**Impact**: Evidence collection redundancy, inability to demonstrate continuous compliance
**Action**: Create evidence links for all documented controls from previous audit

### 3. Control Monitoring Gap (High Priority)
**Issue**: No ongoing monitoring of previously implemented controls
**Impact**: Risk of control degradation without detection
**Action**: Implement quarterly control assessment process

### 4. Policy Updates Gap (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Policies may have changed since 2022 audit period
**Impact**: Current policies may not reflect audit-tested versions
**Action**: Review and update policy documentation to current versions

## Recommended Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Days 1-7): Emergency Documentation Update
- Map all 72 controls from CN01-CN72 to current GRC system
- Update control implementation status
- Link existing evidence from previous audit

### Phase 2 (Days 8-14): Evidence Repository Creation
- Create evidence records for all control areas
- Document current policy versions
- Establish evidence collection procedures

### Phase 3 (Days 15-30): Control Monitoring Implementation
- Implement ongoing control monitoring
- Establish quarterly assessment process
- Create compliance dashboard

### Phase 4 (Days 31-45): Continuous Improvement
- Review control effectiveness
- Update control procedures as needed
- Prepare for next audit cycle

## Conclusion

The gap assessment reveals that KRATIKAL has strong actual SOC 2 compliance (evidenced by clean 2022 audit) but critical gaps in compliance documentation and tracking. The organization is not starting from zero - it has a solid foundation of implemented controls that simply need to be properly documented and monitored in the current GRC system.

**Primary Risk**: Documentation gaps, not actual compliance gaps
**Primary Opportunity**: Quick wins by updating system to reflect actual implementation status
**Success Metric**: 100% of previously compliant controls reflected accurately in GRC system within 30 days
